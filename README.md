# ComputerGraphics
Welcome to COMP Computer Graphics Assignment 1. In this assignment, you will be working on implementing Bresenham’s line-drawing algorithm and exploring 3D graphics concepts using Processing 4.3.

## Getting Started
Read these instructions thoroughly.
Examine the supplied template code carefully. Some operations are already implemented.
Ensure you understand how to change the current color and set a pixel using the provided setPixel() function.
Avoid using Processing’s built-in drawing commands; instead, create images pixel by pixel.
## Coding Standards
Write code with readability in mind.
Use meaningful variable and function names.
Avoid magic numbers.
Ensure that your code compiles, runs, and is testable in Processing 4.3.
Utilize Processing’s PVector class and allowed functions (e.g., max(), min(), abs(), sqrt(), sin(), cos(), Math.pow()).
Note
## Instructions for Running the Template Code
Open the provided PDE files in Processing 4.3.
Ensure the template code runs without errors.
Implement the required functions and follow guidelines mentioned above.
Test your code using the provided display mode.
Submit the completed assignment as per the instructions.
Good luck with your assignment! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to the course instructor or teaching assistant.
